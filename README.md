# Recruit A Hobbit

### The West Farthing Resettlement Initiative

Software Development Bootcamp - Week 3 Project - Browser based idle game where you recruit hobbits and purchase upgrades to help repopulate The Shire.

# Features

- Recruit hobbits using the 'Recruit Hobbit' button at the top
- As you gain enough hobbits to afford them new upgrades will appear in the panel at the bottom, allowing you to automatically generate a certain number of hobbits per second.
- All values (current hobbits, hobbits per second, next upgrade cost, etc) on page automatically update as they change
- Current game state is saved in local storage so players can carry on where they left off
- Upgrades are pulled from an API and injected into the DOM from the JS file
- Image updates several times as player takes certain items. UI colours update to suit image colours.
- Sound effects and music plays depending on user interaction
- UI layout changes depending on screen size to improve UX regardless of device.
- Options menu allows user to:

  - Mute all sounds
  - Restart the main theme music
  - Reset all game data (on page and storage)
  - Cheat (Add 200,000 hobbits ~~and get insulted~~)

## Future Considerations

- Add ability to upgrade recruit button to add more hobbits each press
- Perhaps add a 'prestige' function to incentivise continued progress
- Add more images and UI colour updates to match as user progresses with upgrades
- Make the UI a bit nicer in general
- Add some more options (display, etc)
- Add/improve accessibility

# Reflection

## What requirements did you achieve?

All of them except for try-catch implementation

## What was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Honestly I forgot about it while implementing the main functionality as I was focusing on main requirements first. Figuring out how to reliably manipulate data and DOM elements after they're generated by an async function retrieving from an API took me a lot longer than I expected. By the time I remembered about the Try-catch stretch goal I had all my JS code pretty much complete, and couldn't see an easy way to implement any meaningful error handling without causing a lot of extra work. Something I'd have done with more time, and in hindsight something to do when initially coding the functions.

The upgrades are _technically_ handled via multiple functions, but I feel I have still met the requirement as the main upgrade function implements all of the upgrades in one with the subsequent functions called on the array of upgrades as a whole.

## Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission

List of features above that hopefully gives a quick idea of how it works. Feedback based on intended features would be great - thanks!

## What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

As mentioned earlier, it took me some time to figure out how to retrieve API data in an async function, yet have the retrieved data and associated DOM elements generated in the function to be mutable outside of the function. A lot of trial and error.

## What went really well and what could have gone better?

I think it went ok overall. I'm not as happy with this as I was with previous assignments as it still feels incomplete, though I think I started out too ambitious and lost some time as a result of spending too long on ultimately trivial aspects.

# User Requirements

## User Stories

    🐿️ As a developer, I want to retrieve upgrade information from an API so that all the developers working on the game can access a single, consistent source of up-to-date information.
    🐿️As a user, I want to be able to purchase upgrades from the shop so that I can enhance my gameplay experience.
    🐿️ As a developer, I want to use functions effectively to keep my code organised and reusable.
    🐿️ As a user, I’d like the website to respond dynamically so that my interactions with the website are responsive and smooth.
    🐿️ As a user, I want my cookie count and relevant game information to be stored in local storage so that my progress is saved and I can continue playing from where I left off later.
    🐿️ As a user, I want the cookie count to increment automatically and the game state to update each second so that the game progresses even when I’m not actively clicking.
    🐿️ As a user, I want the game state to be managed every second using setInterval to ensure my progress is saved and the game remains updated.

## Requirements

    🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
    🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
    🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
    🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
    🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
        - Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

## Stretch Goals

    🐿️ As a developer, I want to use a single function to handle all upgrades, so that the code is more organized and easier to maintain.
    🐿️ As a user, I want the game to include animations, sound effects, or other visual effects, so that my experience is more engaging and enjoyable.
    🐿️ As a developer, I want the README to provide a clear project description, deployment instructions, and other relevant information, so that it’s easy to understand and use the project.
    🐿️ As a user, I want the game to handle errors well, so that I have a smooth experience even when something goes wrong.
    🐿️ As a user, I want a menu to adjust game options like sound effects and display preferences, so that I can customize the game to my liking.

## Stretch Requirements

    🏹 Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.
    🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
    🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.
    🏹 Implement error handling using try/catch.
    🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.
